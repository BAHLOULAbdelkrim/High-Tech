High-Tech Hugo site (demo)
-------------------------
Structure created for a Hugo site to deploy to Cloudflare Pages.

Important:
- Replace images in /static/images with your real images (slide1..4, smartphones.png, etc.).
- The site uses local assets/css/main.css and assets/js/main.js
- To run locally: install Hugo and run `hugo server` in this folder.
- baseURL already set to https://high-tech.pages.dev/ in config.toml

Features implemented (demo):
- Header with two rows of menus (6 per row), hover color inversion and shine effect via CSS.
- Slider (slide1..4) rotating every 3s; when clicking a menu, the cover shows that menu image and submenus render in the side area.
- Search box and language buttons (demo actions).
- 9 latest articles on home (generated sample content).
- Responsive burger menu for mobile.
- Article layout with 4 tabs and an animated-style tech sheet placeholder.
- i18n scaffolding in config for FR, EN, AR (content pages are in French by default).
